My research interests are development economics and program evaluation. I am particularly interested in these topics: how families break free from the cycle of poverty; transitions over the life course (i.e., labor market, marital, parenthood transitions); how people make decisions about time and gender differences in time-use allocation; and the impact evaluation of anti-poverty and inequality programs.
