Welcome! I am a student in the University of Cambridge's MPhil in Economic Research. My main research interest is empirical microeconomics and program evaluation, with a focus on poverty, labor, population, and gender. I am currently working on time-use surveys in Indonesia, India, and Lesotho and the determinants of marital transitions in Indonesia.

Prior to joining the University of Cambridge, I was a Research Assistant at PROSPERA (Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Economic Development) and International Labor Organization (ILO). I earned my BA in Economics from the University of Indonesia.
