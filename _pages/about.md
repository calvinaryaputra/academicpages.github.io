Welcome! I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My research interests include development economics and program evaluation, with a focus on population, labor, family, and gender.

Prior to my PhD, I was a Research Assistant at PROSPERA (Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Economic Development), the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Institute for Economic and Social Research (LPEM FEB UI), and the Demographic Institute (LD FEB UI).
