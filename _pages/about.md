Welcome! I am a PhD student in Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My research interests include empirical microeconomics and program evaluation, with a focus on poverty, labor, family, and population.

Prior to my PhD, I studied at the University of Cambridge and the University of Indonesia. I was also a Research Assistant at PROSPERA (Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Economic Development), the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Institute for Economic and Social Research (LPEM FEB UI), and the Demographic Institute (LD FEB UI).
